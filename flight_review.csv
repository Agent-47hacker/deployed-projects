" I am scheduled for the morning, 2 days after the fact, yes..not sure why my evening flight was the only one Cancelled Flightled"

" Flew ORD to Miami and back and  had great crew, service on both legs. THANKS"
 7 that's horse radish üò§üê¥
" so our flight into ORD was delayed because of Air Force One, but the last flight to SBN is at 8:20, 5 mins from now we just landed."
 Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? incompetent beyond belief
 that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not.
 That'd be nice! Hoping to rack up enough miles to take a trip to Seattle and enjoy a perfect latte in the city of coffee.
" frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United."
 yeah haha. Never been in one. It's expensive üòÇüòÇ and we will!!!!! So much fun! destinationdragons
 MCO-&gt;DCA flight almost full of people screwed by the MSY-DCA Cancelled Flightation.  and  didn't Cancelled Flight. SWA=mistake.

 you're killing me sche a flight to board 3 min after mine arrived with gate on other side of airport genious
 8 weeks to refund this ticket - 0372389047497?!? - totally unacceptable.  Fix this or I'll put it on blast on social media and TV
 no private msg me and will provide details...u really need customer svc training for your staff
can you not? Our fleet's on fleek. 
 any info on why flight 704 from SJU to JFK is already delayed 2 1/2 hours?
", I've tried no less than 8 times today to get in touch with your service desk beginning at 8:30 EST.  I'm having no luck -help!"
 new problem...had wrong last name on reservation which is airways fixed. New can't get through TSA
 Any possible chance of SWA bringing back service between LGA-BWI? It would make it much easier to connect to the west coast.
  who runs the show at the airport have a boarding pass says us airways and I have to wait in American line yousuck
 computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!

 Now you've Cancelled Flightled my flight. First a priority ticket bumped and now this. You're losing customers. People are furious.
. can you connect me to a person without having to wait 2+ hours on hold? I still haven't been able to resolve the problem.
 They're all reservations numbers and none are in Hungary. And my phone not working here. You make it too difficult.
 we checked in right at 24hr mark. Boarding C group with kids ages 6&amp;8 dnt want to be split. What sld we do?

 the staff was rather efficient and got us solutions just freaked me out a little being in limbo in the air.
" flight from vegas to houston Cancelled Flighted this morning ""due to operation"" what does this mean!???? Thank god I woke up early today!"
" PHL why does it take an hour to offload bags, especially after taking 30+ min to get a jetway to get off plane after landing?"
" I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems."
" 4hrs Late Flightr i get a call back, and immediately disconnected"
 won't waive $200 fee due to neptune. Can't use credit w/o paying fee. Couldnt get to destination to use their tic waivethefee
"Is it insulting that   offer a ""non required $50 voucher as a goodwill offering..At least my bag can fly round trip"
" I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket."
" I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep."
 cust serv reps who are unable to change reservations in your system Check in unaware of Cancelled Flights that I got word on night before
" just give up.  Your service is terrible.  If I wasn't forced to use United on certain routes, I never would."
 can I get any kind of update on the delayed flight from Boston to Houston at 7:30? Really need to be back home tonight!
" I was under the impression when there is an 8 hour delay in your flight because of equipment failure, compensation is offered?"
" Looks like 'On February 19, 2015, we will open our schedule for sale through October 30, 2015' - know what time that will be?"
" that would be appreciated. Just please don't send me to the same page with long form &amp; limited characters.
Direct email?"
 do you have an email??

 thanks for being so bad you make a two day train trip look appealing!!
 this is getting ridiculous. Now we're missing our connection.
 You really should clean the food and coffee stains off of the area around the seats when new passengers come aboard. Gross!
 Missing flight attendant = Delayed Flight. Prime example how 1 person impacts 100's of people. HNL -&gt; IAH (UA252) wastedtime
"  call the number listed? sure! by next Friday, I should get a real live person on the line "
 change fee = same price of new ticket... Not logical
Stop this madness : Our fleet's on fleek.
